# Friday Night Funkin' - Sword Engine
Sword Engine is based off of Psych Engine, which was originally used on the [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), it's intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

## Compiling:
Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

**I would recommend following the compile guide at:**
[The Original Funkin Game's Github](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin)

Scroll down to the "build instructions" section and go from there.

***MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE CODE FOR THIS ENGINE AND NOT THE ORIGINAL BASE GAME FIRST.***

One last thing, you will need to install LuaJIT along with the other libraries such as `flixel-addons` and etc.

You can do this with: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts (why), delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

## Optimization Mode
For some reason this is SUPER FUCKY on Windows and i have zero clue why, it pisses me off so much

Basically this just removes backgrounds and characters, This SHOULD be something you can use in Lua but i don't know how `FunkinLua.hx` works lmao

Not like i could test anyways, i'm on Linux for fuck's sake.

## To-do list:
* [DONE] Note skins in the options menu
* [DONE] Note skins that only apply to the opponent
* > [WORKS WITH ISSUES] Speed feature for songs [Songs don't end properly if the speed is changed period.]
* This issue will be fixed soon hopefully.
* [NO PROGRESS YET] Custom difficulties without source [Hell]
* [NO PROGRESS YET] Skip song & Skip intro in Pause Menu only because fuck Skip Intro being in gameplay
* [NO PROGRESS YET] Extra keys [TRUE HELL, MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ADDED LOL]

* Extra keys got banished to the bottom of the list, ain't no way i'm doing that shit
* After adding speed

## Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes
![](https://i.imgur.com/h6Ja7eT.png)
* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with two example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.

## Improved Animation Debug menu (Press 8 in-game on a Debug build)
![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44785097/127721062-f912853c-2513-41b8-bd66-fd80d9d4ee0f.png)
* You can now press Save Offsets to save a .txt file with the editted offsets
* You can also now change the characters while on the Menu
* Go back to the game by pressing Escape
NOTE: This should be used for fixing your character floating or being slightly under the ground! It's not for texture editting.

## Story mode menu rework:
![](https://i.imgur.com/UB2EKpV.png)
* Added a different BG to every song (less Tutorial)
* All menu characters are now in individual spritesheets, makes modding it easier.

## Credits menu
![](https://i.imgur.com/NdIQt3d.png)
* You can add a head icon, name, description and a Redirect link for when the player presses Enter while the item is currently selected.

## Awards/Achievements
* The engine comes with 16 example achievements that you can mess with and learn how it works (Check Achievements.hx and search for "checkForAchievement" on PlayState.hx)

## Options menu:
* You can change Note colors, Controls and Preferences there.
 * On Preferences you can toggle Downscroll, Anti-Aliasing, Framerate, Low Quality, Note Splashes, Hide Hud elements, Flashing Lights, etc.

## Other gameplay features:
* When the enemy hits a note, it plays the note hit animation on their strum, just like when the player hits a note.
* Lag doesn't impact the camera movement and player icon scaling anymore.
* Some stuff based on Week 7's changes has been put in (Background colors on Freeplay, Note splashes)
